# Sampling protocol

Verbalized Sampling at every input. Every pick traces to a millisecond-clock RNG seed + a candidate enumeration logged in `sampling.md`. Any reader can replay `random.Random(seed).sample(range(N), K)` to verify.

## Per-step protocol files

| VS step | Protocol file |
|---|---|
| Framing | `framing-protocol.md` |
| Designer | `designer-vs-protocol.md` |
| Seeds | `seeds-vs-protocol.md` |
| Constraint | this file, §Constraint VS |
| Competitors | `competitor-vs-protocol.md` |
| Domain research | `domain-research-vs-protocol.md` |
| Typography | `typography-vs-protocol.md` |

## The millisecond-clock RNG seed

Every sampling step opens a fresh seed from `int(time.time() * 1000)`. The seed is one-time-use; the gate against re-rolls is `sampling.md` itself — once a pick is written, the step is closed. Re-rolls require an explicit user action (`resample` or `choose N`), itself logged.

## The external sampling gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The model does not run `random.Random(seed).sample(...)` in its own context. Ever.** Every ms-sample executes through the Bash tool; the picks logged in `sampling.md` MUST match the Bash stdout verbatim. No substitution, no "I picked these and the seed happens to support it," no re-rolling until favorable indices appear.

### The Bash command

For pool size `N`, pick count `K`:

```bash
python3 -c "import random,time,sys; n,k=int(sys.argv[1]),int(sys.argv[2]); s=int(time.time()*1000); print(f'SEED={s}'); print(f'PICKS={sorted(random.Random(s).sample(range(n),k))}')" <N> <K>
```

Stdout shape (`N=6`, `K=2`):

```
SEED=1779604358950
PICKS=[1, 4]
```

The model copies both lines verbatim into `sampling.md`. No editing of `PICKS`. If a pick "feels wrong," the only legal response is `resample` or `new options`.

### Audit trail format

Each ms-sample writes a fenced block to `sampling.md`:

````markdown
**ms-sample command:** `python3 -c "..." 10 2`
**stdout:**
```
SEED=1779604461337
PICKS=[2, 7]
```
**resolved picks:** index 2 → *Paolo Girardi*, index 7 → *Karmazid*
````

The Critic re-runs the seed against `N,K` on every audit block; any mismatch fails the run.

### Single-pick variant

For `K=1`, `random.Random(s).sample(range(n), 1)` returns a 1-element list; the model uses the singleton as the pick. No `randint` shortcuts — every sample goes through `random.sample` so the verification command is uniform.

### What still happens in-model

- Generating the candidate pool (enumeration + verbalized reasoning)
- Applying the brief-fitness gate (which surviving subset feeds the Bash call)
- Recording the picks-to-named-items mapping
- Writing `sampling.md`

What does NOT happen in-model: calling `random.Random(...).sample(...)` mentally; "adjusting" picks based on aesthetic judgment; choosing the seed to favor specific indices.

## Constraint VS

Constraints are brief-conditioned, NOT framing-conditioned. Framing-conditioned constraints cluster around obvious moves for that category; brief-conditioned constraints stay grounded in the actual problem.

A valid constraint is a specific, testable rule that applies to the visual output — something a reviewer could check against the finished artifact without interpreting intent. Examples:

- "No cream backgrounds — white or dark only"
- "Type at one size only across the entire piece"
- "No rounded corners anywhere"
- "Maximum two weights from the chosen typeface"
- "No gradients — flat fills only"
- "Imagery only in black and white"

Invalid: vague rules, process notes, or framing guidance ("keep it minimal," "think about the user journey," "stay true to the framing").

Generate 20 candidates, brief-fitness filter to 6–8 strongest, ms-sample 1 (or 2 if the framing is otherwise generic) via the external gate above. The sampled constraint is binding for the build — not softened by the Designer subagent's taste. Tension between constraint and practitioner habit is productive; the Critic notes where the constraint forced a deviation.

## The present + confirm pattern

Every VS step pauses after sampling to present the pool, the seed, the chosen pick, and a brief justification. The user responds with one of:

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| `continue` | Accept pick; advance. |
| `resample` | Draw a new ms-clock seed against the SAME pool. |
| `choose N` (or `choose N, M` for K>1) | Manual override to specific index. |
| `new options` | Discard pool; re-brainstorm a fresh pool of the step's specified size; present again. |

Every override is logged with the original sampled pick alongside the final accepted pick. The "picks are non-negotiable mid-loop" rule applies to the **model** (subagents cannot re-roll for taste); only the **human** can override.

## Auto mode

Invoke `/inhabited-design auto` to skip the present + confirm pauses. All VS Steps 2–10 fire through without confirmation; audit trail records `mode: auto` at the top of `sampling.md`. Full details: SKILL.md §Auto mode.

## Status-write integration

Each VS step marks its `pipeline_status.md` row `in_progress` before beginning, and `done` after the pick is locked. Per `pipeline-status-protocol.md`.

## `sampling.md` audit trail

Top of file: `mode: interactive | auto`, invoked timestamp, brief-ref.

Per VS step: candidate pool table (full enumeration), the Bash ms-sample command, stdout (`SEED=` + `PICKS=`), resolved picks (named items), user action (interactive mode), final accepted pick, brief justification.

Step 12 appends a `## Synthesis` section per `designer-persona-template.md` §Synthesis schema.

## Framing VS

### Candidate pool (≈40 generated to pole quotas)

| idx | pole | framing | brief-fitness note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | scientific | Edward Tufte data-vis small-multiples discipline | ... |
| 1 | spatial | Bawa Sri Lankan tropical-modernist architect | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Bash ms-sample

\`\`\`bash
python3 -c "..." 40 1
\`\`\`

**stdout:**
\`\`\`
SEED=1716474731482
PICKS=[3]
\`\`\`

**resolved pick:** index 3 → cross-cultural pole → Japanese kakejiku hanging-scroll mounting aesthetic
**user action:** continue
**final accepted:** Japanese kakejiku hanging-scroll mounting aesthetic (cross-cultural)

Justification: [one paragraph — why this earns its keep for the brief + ICP]

## Seeds VS

---

## Domain research VS

### Iteration 2 — additional domain refs
[Bash + new picks + user action — only if iteration feedback opened a direction the bank doesn't cover]

## Typography VS
